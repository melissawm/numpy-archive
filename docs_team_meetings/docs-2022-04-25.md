**Present**: Rohit Goswami, Inessa Pawson, Mars Lee, Jake VanderVaate, Ross Barnowski, Dilia Rueda, Matti Picus

## Topics

- [name=Mars Lee] Dark mode switcher
    - [Link to issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/21390)
    - Recently implemented option (2 weeks ago)
    - Wait for the next PyData Sphinx Theme version to be officially released to implement this
    - Some feel like the black is too dark, Mars will open an issue in the PyData Sphinx Theme repo about customizing colors
    - [Example of multiple different dark mode switcher](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)
- [name=Jake] The light mode syntax highlighting is nicer for people with visual difficulties
- In particular, the dark mode color choice of neon green + neon orange can be viewed as only orange by some people
- [name=Rohit] We should deal with the font-locking (syntax highlighting separately)

- [name=MattiP] Adding a link to [OpenTeams project page](https://www.openteams.com/app/marketplace/project-page-2/587809) for more support? worthwhile?
    - OpenTeams is very new intiative
    - OpenTeams has consultants and acts as a middle-man market. Companies ask OpenTeams for training and development of open-source tools
    - Link between NumPy, NumPy finances (NUMFocus, OpenColletive) and OpenTeams not clear yet
    - We should make clear that NumPy does not officially sanction the contractors/teachers
        - Not same as creating an issue
    - Spyder has some links 
      - https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/troubleshooting/call-for-help.html#openteams-support
      - https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/installation.html#additional-help
  - Upside: There are already companies profitting from teaching and consulting NumPy. Might as well have a sanctioned partner 
  - Downside: external consultants may move NumPy in non-community ways
  - Bring up to Steering Committee to think of statement and come back to issue
  - Need to have a clearer vision of what OpenTeams-NumPy relations would look like before adding an OpenTeams link

- Short discussion on the calendar ics
    - Moving away from Google Calendar
    - Syncing problems
        - Need to subsribe to URL link to sync calendar
        - Download, import from file does not sync and therefore is not recommended
    - Currently only the HackMD link is present
    - Pros --> Even if people don't register through the web they can visit the page and get updates
    - Cons --> Kinda confusing sometimes, needs an additional layer of indirection
    - Possibility: implement calendar widget
        - [Jupyter uses in-browser, Google Calendar widget to show all their events](https://jupyter.org/community#calendar)
        - However, this brings us back to an implicit Google / Outlook / Other dependency
    - We should check that different
    - Make clearer instructions for syncing calendar across diffeernt services (Google Calendar, Outlook), [similar to this example](https://scientific-python.org/calendars/)
    - As of now, should subscribe by url +1

*Action item:* Inessa will communicate this info via all the existing channels.

- TeX issues --> https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19299
