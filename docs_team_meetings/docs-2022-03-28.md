## Topics

* NumPy newsletter
    * You can follow the development for the newsletter here: https://github.com/numpy/numpy-newsletter
    * Inessa will ping contributors who need to respond today, and possibly follow up with the outstanding items in the #newsletter channel on slack.
    * Interviews will be linked in the newsletter but will be hosted on the Scientific Python blog https://github.com/scientific-python/scientific-python.org

* NumPy Newcomers’ Hour – April 7th, 2022 at 4 pm UTC
Presenter: Mars Lee
Topic: Making NumPy accessible with community workshops: how we can involve more people with disabilities in data science.

* The NumPy community Google calendar will be deprecated on June 1st, 2022. Please subscribe to https://scientific-python.org/calendars/numpy.ics to keep track of all NumPy community events.

* Version switcher has been merged to PyData Sphinx theme https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/pull/611
    * We should check to see how to add it to our docs (we need to check or restructure our old documentation first)
    * FWIW Pamphile is working on this for scipy: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/15380

* [Thumbnails for numpy-tutorials landing page](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/123) don't support alt-text (yet). Should we wait for that?

* Gitpod documentation build is broken right now - it seems like breathe is the issue.
    * https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/21252
    * Suggestion: improve the gitpod documentation to include instructions on how to debug and test https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/development_gitpod.html#faq-s-and-troubleshooting
    * It is hard to test programmatically if the gitpod instance is working, but we should be checking it periodically to make sure new users don't face problems when using gitpod.
    * [name=rossbar] TODO: Open an issue about setting up CI/some sort of automated verification that the gitpod instance is working
