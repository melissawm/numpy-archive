* [name=Inessa Pawson] April 7th NumPy Newcomers’ Hour

A video recording is available on the NumPy YouTube channel: https://youtu.be/jI4pax8HX6c

- [name=Melissa] [Social media guidelines](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/issues/437)
- [name=Melissa] [DOC: * vs \cdot vs \cdotp vs \times? #21310](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/21310)
    - Should only be about LaTeX math environments
    - We should limit the amount of LaTeX that goes into docstrings as they will be read on the terminal/repl/ipython console.

- [name=Melissa] [DOC: define/use 'selection object' in basics.indexing.rst #20645](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20645)
    - Different terminology being used in different parts of the page
    - Do we mean "generic object" or "Python object"? The complication is that some cases result in basic indexing, while other result in advanced indexing (which can be very different in performance)
    - Need more input on what specific keywords mean. Maybe have a seperate section explaining it.

- [name=bhavukkalra] [Adding Gitpod FAQ Debugging/Testing and building image locally](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21263). Working on it. Will create a new PR for building Gitpod image locally. Need suggestions on how the paths should look like.
    - Use a general path like `<path-to-your-repos>/numpy`
    - Feel free to use images for instructions; make sure alt-text is correctly added and that images are not too large

- Google Season of Docs: questions and discussion

- General note: Version switcher from the PyData Sphinx Theme has been enabled for SciPy: https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/index.html
    - PR https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/15380
