## Topics

- [name=Rohit] Bumping to the top for some urgency (sorry):
  - [Mailing list discussion about PDF removal here](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/numpy-discussion@python.org/thread/CCTBM3GONFQWM3DUZRBBT3YYGKXGGPLT/)
  - Navigation for html is not ideal; this should be fixed irrespective of the PDF generation
  - There are issues of size of the docker image and other breakages coming from the LaTeX/PDF generation
  - Rohit makes a point that this is necessary for a possible group of people who are not voicing their needs on github/mailing list
  - Ross suggests refactoring the generation of the PDF docs to a scheduled CI job that has a designated maintainer (Rohit mentions he could take that up)
  - Lev mentions that .chm files are also a possibility, as well as Dash (MacOS), Velocity (Windows), Zeal (Linux, Windows), DevDocs (Chrome), Little Drops (Android).
  - Proposal: come up with a refactoring solution for the next docs meeting --> Rohit will have a demo

- [name=Inessa] Translations on crowdin: https://support.crowdin.com/modifying-project-participants-roles/#project-roles
    - We should check if ownership transfer can be done with Shekhar (Inessa will contact Shekhar)
    - If not, we can check for an enterprise-level account with NumFOCUS
- There was a [PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21522) to add a french readme, should we consider this or maybe consider this after on numpy.org is online? 
    At this time, we are not planning on translating NumPy docs or anything else beyond numpy.org.

- [name=bhavuk kalra] Tutorial on Finding and Editing Doc Strings(Rough draft) suggestions :- [Find and Edit Doc Strings](https://hackmd.io/Uv7TotDjRRKa3iuwf_PpCw?view)
    - [name=Melissa] https://hackmd.io/@melissawm/Sy1SGhvD9
    - Melissa and Bhavuk to submit a (joint?) PR

- [name=Melissa] https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/2067
- [name=Ross] NumPy tutorials CI issues
    - atari-py/gym is creating problems. The proposal is to freeze the Reinforcement learning notebook and remove those dependencies from requirements/CI.

- [name=Brigitta] If the pytest doctesting goes forward with doctestplus, Brigitta would be interested in being involved in the team effort. [SDG proposal for pytest-doctestplus](https://hackmd.io/5uRx7MNhTqSLIFkPnFLY0g)

### For next meeting:

- [name=bhavuk kalra] Should we close these PR's or Keep it around for further discussion - 1)  [Revert PR for breathe](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21270) (Made just in case, If something didn't worked out). 2) [Update Gitpod FAQ](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21263)

- [name=bhavuk kalra] Mathematical formulae rendering is slow, getting tracked in this issue - [MathJAX rendering is slow](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/21419), suggestions on the test done?
