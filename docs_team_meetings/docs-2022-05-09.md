## Topics

- [pydata-sphinx-theme community representatives](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/issues/645)
    - No action required at this point 
- PyCon 2022 Sprint
    - Hosted in-person by Inessa, 7-8 people attended
    - Not much for remote volunteers
    - Issue opened about difficulty building docs in Gitpod. Versioning problem with latest version of breathe
    - Should we issue a warning about using Gitpod? Ping a condaforge or breathe maintainer?
    - Melissa to ping a condaforge maintainer about this
    - Can probably be solved by switching breathe version from 4.33. to 4.31
    - [name=Bhavuk Kalra]
        - "I can try with ubuntu. I also did the setup on remote desktop on azure and I had seen those warnings. I have been delaying it for a while now to finally test. I'll do it right now in the background" -> WARNING: doxygenfunction: Cannot find file...
        - Succesfully reproduced error but maybe specific to ubuntu
        - breathe or doxygen warning?
        - Sphinx still build docs, only thing not built at C examples
        - Gitpod still works, but these error messages can scare newcomers
        - Sphinx errors: sphinx designed as state machine, under the hood are various states, with rebuild different state from clean build. Good for cacheing, plug-ins into build process but difficult to trace back problem
- Follow up discussion on issue created from previous meeting
    - [name=Jake] [Dark mode syntax highlighting isn't as color-blind friendly as the light mode](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/issues/649) 
    - Current working solution is user changing theme colors individually
    - However, we want accessibility to be easier to access, bring upstream to theme
    - Someone could make PR of what a better dark mode 'native' theme could look like
    - We could push for this more, since [accessibilty has been identified as a priority for PyData Sphinx Theme](https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/issues/61)
- Ross is working on [updating numpy-tutorials](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/123)
    - Myst-NB supports alt-text
    - Renaming could apply only to NumPy tutorials
    - Looking at [NEP 44 Restructuing NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0044-restructuring-numpy-docs.html), nowhere is explicit method how to organize
    - Tutorials are currently organized by [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
        - Lots of overlap in tutorials vs explanation
    - Could add tags, allowing things to be tagged with 2+ things (document both for beginners and explanation). Improve discoverability
    - Finding a custom directive that adds tags
    - Melissa, Lucy Liu working on sphinx-gallery tags, could bring back to NumPy tutorials
    - Possible UI: drop down bar of tags, click on one, opens an index page of that tag
    - Other projects could benefit from this, mathplotlib currently doing it by hand
- Software testing
    - Need to remove outdated docs on testing
    - May move from runtests to the CLI SciPy has, maybe Meson
    - Can't run doctests with PyTest flags
    - Potential small development grant: moving from doctests to PyTest
        - Relatively well-defined, more about adoption
        - For someone interested in testing in documentation
        - [Apply for NUMFOCUS Round 2](https://numfocus.org/programs/small-development-grants)
Call for Proposals Announcement: May 6, 2022
Proposal Submission Deadline: June 3, 2022
Committee Selection Deadline: June 17, 2022
Notification to Applicants Deadline: July 15, 2022
    - Need someone to mention in this week's NumPy community meeting, Melissa won't be there but will crosspost on NumPy Slack
- Opinions on the [card styling PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/21456)?
    - [name=Ross] Make styling more consistent with other projects? For example with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) and [scipy](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/index.html)
    - [name=Mars] Pamphile's PR makes resized images more proportional and centered in cards, so better than other projects. Differences from other projects are minor, still has strong visual link to other projects
    - Could move forward with merge for now
- [name=Mukulika] Action item for [Need to remove easy_install usage from doc/Makefile](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/18246)?
    - Possibility: Remove easy_install, replace with regular commands
    - Possibility: remove makedist, keep easy_install
    - No action needed now, Ralf and Chuck already discussing
