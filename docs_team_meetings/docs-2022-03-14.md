## 2022-03-14 NumPy Documentation Team meeting

- Time: 4PM UTC
- Join via Zoom at: [link](https://zoom.us/j/96219574921?pwd=VTRNeGwwOUlrYVNYSENpVVBRRjlkZz09)

**Present**: Melissa Mendonça, Noa Tamir, Alex de Siqueira, Jake VanderVaate, Inessa Pawson, Rohit Goswami, Mars Lee, Mukulika Pahari, Ross Barnowski, Bhavuk Kalra, Md Shahriyar Al Mustakim Mitul

## Topics

- Should we have a style guide like https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/13955?
    - Rohit suggests we could also get a guide for when to use each of the theme elements (like admonitions, warnings, sphinx panels etc)
    - This specific guide might not be directly applicable to NumPy.
    - Let's have our own guide since every project is different and we may not agree with any one external project
    - Could be phrased more as advice for beginners and documentation writers than guidelines to be enforced. But do we need another guide for beginners?
    - For newcomers, it could help them understand if information is needed vs optional
    - Potential GSOD project

- PDF in docs (Noa has a suggestion)
    - Noa's suggestion: Recommend users to use 'Save/Print PDF' option in browser instead of NumPy team releasing PDFs
    - Letting the user customize the PDF output to be suited to their needs (accessibility)
      - Color
      - Fonts
  - Recently ran into the problem of not having the devdocs pdf ([name=Rohit]  wanted to look up DLPack on my Kobo but I only had 1.22 which didn't include it -_-)
  - We could enable plausible tracking for that link
  - Some members are against switching away from LaTeX because of size, hyperlinks and the fact that we don't need syntax highlighting for most pdf outputs
      - We should split the PDF into chapters and distribute it as a zip similar to the way Python documentation is provided
      - [name=Rohit] is willing to help with TeX clean up to save the PDFs
  - We should make documentation of making the PDF if we go forward with this
      - Related issue: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/19299

- Mukulika’s presentation for the latest NumPy Newcomers Hour has been posted: https://youtu.be/5bfFI2WuuMA

- GSoD (March 25th)
    - Detailing how people actually navigate through the documentation
    - People/Personas, Journey Maps

- A proposal for a tutorial:
https://mail.python.org/archives/list/numpy-discussion@python.org/message/DTIS7BNGOJU7YZZNAAYUEYIRXTEIKTJW/
    - To get feedback and concrete ideas, feel free to open an issue on https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials
    - Make sure we explain the motivations behind building these algorithms using only NumPy (are there use cases for this, or is it purely pedagogical?)
    - Concrete suggestions (more) --> no external libraries 

- NumPy newsletter:
    - Contributors are needed: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RDL328nJiwVZVFR-A2jii1p_kcgvuSOn9Dihb75ecB4/edit?usp=sharing
    - Extended discussion: what extent, option and format does the Newsletter or other teams integrate into the wider NumPy community?
        - Let people decide what extent they want to join
        - Slack as a central place for all teams
        - But Slack may be overwhelming for someone interested in only 1 team
        - Creating multiple points of entry for contributors
        - While more options/point of entry could be overwhelming, there is Inessa as NumPy Experience Lead to follow and help along new contributors
        - Can discuss further in Community Meeting

- General comment: we could have a form at the homepage instead of asking people to send an email to join the slack
    - Lower barrier of entry
    - Could use LinkTree
